          <h3>As a passionate believer in the democracy of reading, I don't think it's the task of the author of a book to tell the reader what it means.</h3>
          <p>The meaning of a story emerges in the meeting between the words on the page and the thoughts 
            in the reader's mind. So when people ask me what I meant by this story, or what was the message 
            I was trying to convey in that one, I have to explain that I'm not going to explain.
          </p>
          <p>Anyway, I'm not in the message business; I'm in the "Once upon a time" business.</p>
          <h3>New Years Honours 2019</h3>
          <p>I was very surprised and honoured to be offered a knighthood. I believe the profession of letters 
            should be recognised as having a proper place in the life of the nation, along with science, and sport, 
            and music, and scholarship, and many other human activities. Many people I admire, such as Quentin Blake, Ellen MacArthur, Chris Hoy, Jacqueline Wilson, Nicholas Hytner, Jocelyn Bell Burnell, Bryn Terfel, Ray Davies, Mary Beard — far too many to list — have been happy to accept a knighthood or damehood, and I am proud to be in their company.
          </p>
          <p>I’m immensely grateful to those who have worked so hard over many years to edit, publish, illustrate, 
            and sell my books, and to the Society of Authors, which does so much for the profession of authorship. 
            I’m most grateful of all to those who continue to read my books, and I hope they don’t have to work as 
            hard as those who edit them.
